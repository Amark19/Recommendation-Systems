So to implement this we have two methods 
1)Content base filtering
2)collaberative filtering

1)content based filtering:
	In this we focus on genre or categories of the product such as in the movies we
usually have action,adventure,thriller,horror.
Let suppose user u1 watches movies of action,adventure and thirller .Then we can recomm
end u1 movies which comes under this category and has best avg ratings.

It analyzes characterics of product or movies.

2)collabarative based:
	Here it analyses the behaviour of users that mean if user u1 gives rating 5,4,5 to
m1,m2,m3 movie and u1 gives 4,4,5 rating then behaviour of u1,u2 is same so similar
movies can be recommended to them.
